# Caesar's Chiper Calculator
Caesar's Cipher was named after Julius Caesar, who used this cipher  to encrypt his private messages. The cipher takes each letter in a word and rotates it by a number. For example, if the cipher was a ROT1 (rotate by 1 letter), then every a in the message would show up as a b. This is a ROT13 cipher. It will encrypt your messages by rotating the letters by 13 characters.
